# JavaScript Functions and Objects - Exercises

## **Exercise 1**
Define a function `calculateArea` that takes two parameters `length` and `width` and returns the area of a rectangle. Then, define a function `calculatePerimeter` that takes the same parameters and returns the perimeter of the rectangle. Use both functions to log the area and perimeter of a rectangle with length 5 and width 10.

## **Exercise 2**
Create an object `car` with properties `make`, `model`, and `year`. Add a method `getCarAge` that calculates the car's age based on the current year and logs "This car is [age] years old". Assume the current year is 2024 and call the method to display the car's age.

## **Exercise 3**
Write an arrow function `findLargest` that takes three numbers as parameters and returns the largest of the three. Use the function to find the largest number among 3, 15, and 9, and log the result.

## **Exercise 4**
Define a function `userInfo` that accepts a username as a parameter and logs "Welcome, [username]". Inside this function, define and immediately invoke another function named `displayMessage` that logs "User [username] has logged in". Ensure that both functions have access to the `username` variable.

## **Exercise 5**
Create an HTML form that allows the user to input two numbers. Write a function named `performCalculation` that reads the two numbers from the input fields and logs whether their sum is even or odd. Trigger this function when a button is clicked.
