1. Write a smart contract MathFunctions which includes the following functions:

   findLargest( ) : accepts three numbers and returns the largest number.

   eg: findLargest(3,4,1) => 4

   getDigit( ): accepts a single-digit number and returns the digit in words.

   eg: getDigit(4) => four; getDigit(33) => invalid Input

checkSign( ): accepts an int value and returns whether its positive, negative or zero

   eg: checkSign(-4) => negative ; checkSign(0) => zero
